#### Report card System

A command-line application built in Java that allows educators to input student grades across multiple subjects, calculate total scores, assign letter ranks, and generate a formatted, comprehensive class report card summary

#### **Features**
- **Batch Processing:** Generate report cards for multiple students in a single session.
- **Detailed Subject Tracking:** Records grades for 6 specific subjects (English, Math, History, Geography, Science, and Programming).
- **Total Score Calculation:** Automatically sums up all subject grades for each student.
- **Letter Ranking:** Assigns a rank (A, B, C, D, F) based on the student's total score.
- **Class Summary:** Calculates and displays the total sum and average grade for every subject across all students.
- **Rank Distribution:** Provides a final tally of how many A's, B's, C's, D's, and F's were awarded in the class.
